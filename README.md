# Advent of Code 2021

Rust discovery by solving [advent of code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
I tried to use the maximum number of rust features I could, so implementation are not always clean and sobre ^^.

## Usage

```
cargo run [day] [input-path]`
```

To solve the puzzle of a specific day, just run the program with the number of the day as argument. You can also specific a specific input file. By default the program will solve the puzzle of the current day with its associated data.
